"S" - for moving the car backwards.

"Space" - for stopping the car.

Mouse wheel scrolling - for zooming the camera in and out.

Special features:

To win the game you have to do 3 laps under 4 minutes.
The game has obsticles, and different textures, such as road and grass. When on grass the car will move slower,
as grass has more friction.

 
Some of the bugs encountered:

The wheel colliders wouldn't give callback, so we had to create a box collider to detect collision response.
The box collider must be dynamic in order to detect the track which is static. Which gave a bug when the box got
to a velocity of 80 in the y axis, bugging the car untill it got to velocity around 220.
So to fix it we set its bounding box velocity to 220.
